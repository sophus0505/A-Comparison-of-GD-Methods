# A Comparison of Gradient Descent Methods 
## Code accompanying the first obligatory paper in MAT2000

The code contains implementations of gradient descent, backtracking gradient descent and two way backtracking gradient descent that takes a continuous function 
F : R2 --> R and its gradient dF. The results used in the paper can be generated by running the file main.py.

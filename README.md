# An Implementation of Three Different Gradient Descent Methods 
## Code accompanying the first obligatory paper in MAT2000

### The methods implemented are taken from the 2019 paper *Backtracking gradient descent method for general C1 functions, with applications to Deep Learning* by Truong, T. T. and Nguyen, T. H. arXiv: [1808.05160](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05160)

The code contains implementations of gradient descent, backtracking gradient descent and two way backtracking gradient descent that takes a continuous function 
F : R2 --> R and its gradient dF. The results used in the paper can be generated by running the file main.py.
